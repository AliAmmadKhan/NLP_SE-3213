1. Introduction
With the exponential growth of digital information, users often face challenges in comprehending lengthy or complex web content. To address this, our project “WebPage AI Chatbot Chrome Extension” integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with browser-based tools to create an intelligent assistant that analyzes and summarizes webpage content in real time.

The chatbot allows users to interact with any webpage through a conversational interface, asking questions such as “What is this page about?” or “Summarize this content”. By combining content extraction, NLP-based analysis, and user-friendly UI design, this project demonstrates the real-world application of NLP concepts in enhancing online information accessibility.
2. Objectives
1. Develop a Chrome Extension capable of integrating seamlessly with webpages.
2. Implement NLP features including text preprocessing, keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, summarization, and entity recognition.
3. Provide real-time chatbot interaction through popup and embedded widget interfaces.
4. Enhance user experience with features such as floating chat indicators, context menus, quick actions, and chat history.
5. Demonstrate educational value by showcasing practical applications of core NLP techniques within a web-based project.
3. Methodology
The project followed a structured methodology:
- Requirement Analysis: Identified Chrome Extension APIs and selected lightweight NLP techniques.
- Design: Defined architecture using service workers, content scripts, and popup interfaces; created NLP pipeline.
- Implementation: Built frontend using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript; implemented NLP algorithms (TF-IDF, sentiment analysis, summarization).
- Testing: Conducted functional and performance testing on diverse webpages.
